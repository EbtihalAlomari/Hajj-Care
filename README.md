# Hajj-Care
**Hajj Care** is a software engineering project designed to improve health monitoring and emergency response for the pligrims during Hajj
The system consists of two main components:
1. **SmartBand** - worn by pilgrims to monitor vital signs,
2. **Mobile Application** - used by three roles : pilgrims , the medical teams , and system admins
If the SmartBand detects an emergency or abnormal vital signs, it sends an instant **alert** to the nearst medical team through the application , allowing quick response and efficient healthcare delivery.
